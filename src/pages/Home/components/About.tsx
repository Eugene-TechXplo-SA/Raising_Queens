          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Raising Queens Foundation was born out of both lived experience and a deep awareness of the challenges facing women and youth 
            in South Africa. Our country continues to grapple with staggering gender inequalities, high levels of gender-based violence (GBV), 
            and some of the highest youth unemployment rates in the world. For many girls and young women, these realities mean limited 
            opportunities, cycles of poverty, and a lack of safe spaces where they can dream, grow, and thrive.<br /><br />
            For me, this mission is deeply personal. I come from a GBV background and was raised by a single mother who embodied both woman 
            power and soft strength. Watching her resilience shaped my understanding of what true empowerment looks like — quiet courage, 
            dignity, and the will to rise above circumstances. Yet I also knew how isolating it could feel to navigate these struggles without 
            guidance.<br /><br />
            Raising Queens Foundation was my way of becoming the "older sister" I never had — someone who could walk alongside young girls 
            and women, reminding them of their worth and equipping them with the tools to succeed. What started as a dream has grown into a 
            movement: creating safe spaces, building digital and leadership skills, and breaking cycles of inequality.<br /><br />
            Our vision is simple but urgent — to raise a generation of Queens who are resilient, confident, and unstoppable, 
            rewriting the narrative for women and youth in South Africa and beyond.
